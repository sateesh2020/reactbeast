<p>React is a UI library developed at Facebook to facilitate the creation of interactive, stateful &amp; reusable UI components. It is used at Facebook in production, and Instagram.com is written entirely in React.</p>

<p>One of it’s unique selling points is that not only does it perform on the client side, but it can also be rendered server side, and they can work together inter-operably.</p>

<p>It also uses a concept called the Virtual DOM that selectively renders subtrees of nodes based upon state changes. It does the least amount of DOM manipulation possible in order to keep your components up to date.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-does-the-virtual-dom-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-the-virtual-dom-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does the Virtual DOM work?</h2>

<p>Imagine you had an object that you modeled around a person. It had every relevant property a person could possibly have, and mirrored the persons current state. This is basically what React does with the DOM.</p>

<p>Now think about if you took that object and made some changes. Added a mustache, some sweet biceps and Steve Buscemi eyes. In React-land, when we apply these changes, two things take place. First, React runs a “diffing” algorithm, which identifies what has changed. The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff.</p>

<p>The way React works, rather than taking the real person and rebuilding them from the ground up, it would only change the face and the arms. This means that if you had text in an input and a render took place, as long as the input’s parent node wasn’t scheduled for reconciliation, the text would stay undisturbed.</p>

<p>Because React is using a fake DOM and not a real one, it also opens up a fun new possibility. We can render that fake DOM on the server, and boom, server side React views.</p>

<h2>
<a id="jsx" class="anchor" href="#jsx" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JSX</h2>

<p>It’s called JSX, and it is a Javascript XML syntax transform. This lets you write HTML-ish tags in your Javascript. I say HTML-ish because there are a couple gotchas. You are really just writing XML based object representations.</p>
